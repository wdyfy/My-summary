# 210. Course Schedule II

There are a total of _n_ courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished   
             course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both     
             courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. 
             So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .
```

**Note:**

1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

1.用什么算法: Topological sorting

2.为什么用这个算法: 简单有向图

3.代码实现要注意的地方：注意区分先修和后修课程的顺序，即有向图的方向。

4.代码实现可以优化的地方

5.时间复杂度：O\(m+n\)

6.空间复杂度：O（1）
