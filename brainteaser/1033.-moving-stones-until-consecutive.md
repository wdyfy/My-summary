# 1033. Moving Stones Until Consecutive

Three stones are on a number line at positions `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Each turn, let's say the stones are currently at positions `x, y, z` with `x < y < z`.  You pick up the stone at either position `x` or position `z`, and move that stone to an integer position `k`, with `x < k < z` and `k != y`.

The game ends when you cannot make any more moves, ie. the stones are in consecutive positions.

When the game ends, what is the minimum and maximum number of moves that you could have made?  Return the answer as an length 2 array: `answer = [minimum_moves, maximum_moves]`

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 5
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: Move stone from 5 to 4 then to 3, or we can move it directly to 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: a = 4, b = 3, c = 2
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: We cannot make any moves.
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= a <= 100`
2. `1 <= b <= 100`
3. `1 <= c <= 100`
4. `a != b, b != c, c != a`

corner cases:

1.当排序后z - x == 2时，说明没法再移动了，所以返回{0, 0}.

2.当只有两个相连时，最小移动距离就是1。都不相连最小移动距离是2。

最大距离是z-x-2

```text
class Solution {
    public int[] numMovesStones(int a, int b, int c) {
        int[] arr = new int[]{a, b, c};
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        if (arr[2] - arr[0] == 2) return new int[]{0, 0};
        return new int[] {Math.min(arr[1] - arr[0], arr[2] - arr[1]) <= 2 ? 1 : 2, arr[2] - arr[0] - 2};
    }
}
```
