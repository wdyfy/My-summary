# 137. Clone Graph

Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a `label` and a list of its `neighbors`. Nodes are labeled uniquely.

You need to return a deep copied graph, which has the same structure as the original graph, and any changes to the new graph will not have any effect on the original graph.

#### Example

**Example1**

```text
Input:
{1,2,4#2,1,4#3,5#4,1,2#5,3}
Output: 
{1,2,4#2,1,4#3,5#4,1,2#5,3}

#### Clarification

How we serialize an undirected graph: [http://www.lintcode.com/help/graph/](http://www.lintcode.com/help/graph/)

#### Notice

You need return the node with the same label as the input node.

public class Solution {
    /*
     * @param node: A undirected graph node
     * @return: A undirected graph node
     */
    public UndirectedGraphNode cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode node) {
        // write your code here
        if (node == null) {
            return node;
        }
        ArrayList<UndirectedGraphNode> nodes = getNodes(node);
        // copy i=nodes
        Map<UndirectedGraphNode, UndirectedGraphNode> mapping = new HashMap<>();
        for (UndirectedGraphNode n : nodes) {
            mapping.put(n, new UndirectedGraphNode(n.label));
        }
        // copy edges
        for (UndirectedGraphNode n : nodes) {
            UndirectedGraphNode newNode = mapping.get(n);
            for (UndirectedGraphNode neighbor : n.neighbors) {
                UndirectedGraphNode newNeighbor = mapping.get(neighbor);
                newNode.neighbors.add(newNeighbor);
            }
        }
        return mapping.get(node);
    }
    public ArrayList<UndirectedGraphNode> getNodes(UndirectedGraphNode node) {
        Queue<UndirectedGraphNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<UndirectedGraphNode> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        queue.offer(node);
        set.add(node);
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            UndirectedGraphNode head = queue.poll();
            for (UndirectedGraphNode neighbor : head.neighbors) {
                if (!set.contains(neighbor)) {
                    queue.offer(neighbor);
                    set.add(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        return new ArrayList<UndirectedGraphNode>(set);
    }
}
