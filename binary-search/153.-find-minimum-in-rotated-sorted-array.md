# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

\(i.e.,  `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become  `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`\).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```

```text
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        while (start + 1 < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] < nums[end]) {
                end = mid;
            } else {
                start = mid;
            }
        }
        return Math.min(nums[start], nums[end]);
    }
}
```
