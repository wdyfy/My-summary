# 256. Paint House

There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a `n x 3`cost matrix. For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

**Note:**  
All costs are positive integers.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue. 
             Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
```

class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[][] costs) {
        if (costs == null || costs.length == 0)
            return 0;
        int n = costs.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][3];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if (i == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = costs[i][j];
                } else if (j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][2]) + costs[i][j];
                } else if (j == 2) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1]) + costs[i][j];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][2]) + costs[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        return Math.min(dp[n - 1][0], Math.min(dp[n - 1][1], dp[n - 1][2]));
    }
}
