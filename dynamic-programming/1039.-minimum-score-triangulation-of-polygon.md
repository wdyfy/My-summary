# 1039. Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon



Given `N`, consider a convex `N`-sided polygon with vertices labelled `A[0], A[i], ..., A[N-1]` in clockwise order.

Suppose you triangulate the polygon into `N-2` triangles.  For each triangle, the value of that triangle is the **product** of the labels of the vertices, and the _total score_ of the triangulation is the sum of these values over all `N-2` triangles in the triangulation.

Return the smallest possible total score that you can achieve with some triangulation of the polygon.

1. 
**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The polygon is already triangulated, and the score of the only triangle is 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [3,7,4,5]
Output: 144
Explanation: There are two triangulations, with possible scores: 3*7*5 + 4*5*7 = 245, or 3*4*5 + 3*4*7 = 144.  The minimum score is 144.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: [1,3,1,4,1,5]
Output: 13
Explanation: The minimum score triangulation has score 1*1*3 + 1*1*4 + 1*1*5 + 1*1*1 = 13.
```

**Note:**

1. `3 <= A.length <= 50`
2. `1 <= A[i] <= 100`

class Solution {
    public int minScoreTriangulation(int[] A) {
        int n = A.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        for (int d = 2; d < n; d++) {
            for (int i = 0; i + d < n; i++) {
                int j = i + d;
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for (int k = i + 1; k < j; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + A[i] * A[j] * A[k]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
}
